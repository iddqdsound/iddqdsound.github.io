## Generating Gain Riding Automation with SWS Loudness tool (Rapid-Fire REAPER Tutorials Ep101) ##

![](/blog/rfrt/101/RFRT-EP101.jpg)

Hey folks!  
 In [this episode](https://youtu.be/CqUSI3S7O7Y) we're looking at a slightly faster way to generate LUFS-based Volume automation. We have covered most non-obsolete parts of SWS Resources, which you can find [in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APEZ75IOJ0o&list=PLjvmrOUg3J0pEil4PDHyupUI-9MQwsPmd) and the Loudness Tool was covered in [Episode 69](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJpTV3Zzdtw) in more detail. Today we're just gonna cover the relevant parts!

**The Kenny Gioia Method**

 The wonderful Kenny Gioia covered this topic in [this video](https://youtu.be/tjnrGU83PB4) and this method is inspired by him! In fact, this method has been around way longer than his method of using the JS: Loudness Meter, which is an indication of his genius, cuz no one thought to do a tutorial on that until now!

  There are some trade-offs with each method:
  -Kenny's method gives you a higher resolution (more automation points).  
  -The SWS Loudness tool method is faster as the envelope is generated offline rather than in real-time.  

**Automation Items**  

 Once the graph is generated (as you will see in the video) it needs to be reversed, and also possibly scaled to an appropriate amount based on the mix context and what parameter you automate with the generated envelope. We've also covered Automation Items in the past and you can check that out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf8TFQ8ov_s)



**The Andrew Scheps Parallel Compression aka Rear Buss technique**

 As shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CCzT7WlKAA) Andrew Scheps likes to buss his non-vocal busses to a parallel buss for some extra compression. This is a great technique when you want your vocals to remain upfront without the instruments being drowned out. 

 The settings I use are much gentler than what he does:
 Ratio 2:1  
 Threshold ~ -20dB  
 Attack 5-10ms  
 Release (60000/bpm)  

 Nevertheless, it's a great way to fatten up the mix without having to deal with annoying peaks! 

 Once the buss is set up, you can use the LUFS-Based graph of the vocal performance to gently automate the level of the buss. 

**Conclusion**

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial, and as always let me know if you have any questions, no matter how related/unrelated!
