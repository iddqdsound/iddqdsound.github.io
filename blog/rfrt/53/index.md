## Ripple Delete MIDI Events & How to design your own custom action (Rapid-Fire Reaper Tutorials Ep53)

![](/blog/rfrt/53/113.jpg)

Hey folks!

We interrupt our SWS Resources Tutorial series to create a custom action asked by Liam on YouTube. This was a great question and I couldn't resist! I also wanted to give you some tips for designing your own custom actions! I'd love to make all custom actions forever, more video ideas for me, but also hopefully I can help you have some autonomy in this regard, the ol' "teach how to fish" method!

Every little helps, so even if you send a dollar or two my way, Iâ€™ll be eternally grateful to you.
