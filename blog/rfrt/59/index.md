## How to Split your MIDI Keyboard to play different VSTi (Rapid-Fire REAPER Tutorials Ep59)

![](/blog/rfrt/59/74.jpg)

Hey folks!

Good to be back with another tutorial! We took a vote on the channel and seems like MIDI and SWS tutorials are the type of content y'all want, so in this episode I'm gonna show you how to do split your MIDI Keyboard to play different instruments. This is really useful for jamming or live performances, where you want to play two or more different instruments using one MIDI Keyboard.

For this, all you need is the JS Plugin MIDI Note Filter, which you can download from Reapack. Here's a [video by my friend Myk from Let's talk about Reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2a4QWqZ53Mv) showing you how to do that! Just search for MIDI Note Filter and install it.

Enjoy!
