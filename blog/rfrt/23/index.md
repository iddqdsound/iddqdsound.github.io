## Automation Modes Explained Part 2 (Latch Preview)

![](/blog/rfrt/23/RFRT-EP-23.jpg)

Hey folks!

 Now that we have a firm grasp of mouse-based automation, we can get into writing/performing automation. To do this, you need to understand the different automation modes in REAPER. These are mostly like any other DAW you have seen, but you may not exactly know what each one means, and knowing this is important also to understand part 2 of this blog, where we talk about the Latch Preview mode, which is pretty much exclusive to REAPER and the Ultimate Version of Pro Tools as far as I know!

Here's the video:
