## How to Set up Tab to Transient Pro Tools-style (Rapid-Fire Reaper Tutorials Ep56)

Hey folks!

In [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/UNmnaRw4e0A), I want to show you how to set up the Tab to Transient function from Pro Tools in REAPER. If you've used Pro Tools, you know how useful pressing Tab is for navigating around your project, up to the point where it becomes almost a twitch for you, so this was one of the first things I set up when I migrated to REAPER.

However, it took a bit of work and testing to get it to work like Tab does. You can always assign tab to 'Item Navigation: Move cursor to next transient in items' but the problem is that if you don't have an item selected, it won't do anything, whereas in Pro Tools, if you do that you will go to the start of the next item in your tracks. I figured this out eventually though, and here's the custom action.
