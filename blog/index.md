## FROG Wins Best Final Project!

My first experience with Game Audio Design has been a massive success. Our Video Game FROG, for which I served as Audio Lead and SFX Designer managed to bag the Best Final Project award at the VFS Programming Awards!

With its open-world physics-based gameplay, dynamic sound, amazing music and stunning visuals, FROG has gone above and beyond what was thought possible for a student project of its caliber at VFS.

FROG is the debut game for Team Primitive, and I am proud to have worked alongside fellow VFS Sound Designer and Music Composer Yusuke Konishi as part of the Audio team for the game.
