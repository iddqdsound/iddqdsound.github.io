## MANUAL COMPRESSION??? The dumber (but somehow kinda smart) way to do gain reduction
![](/blog/misc/7/Manual-Comp.png)  

Hey folks!  
 In [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/YaVk_th0RYY) we’re gonna look at manual compression!

**Deconstructing Compression**  
 Compression is quite simple in principle: It's an effect that generates a gain reduction curve, based on guidelines you set for it on when (threshold), how much by (ratio) and how quickly (attack & release) to reduce gain! Give it a knee and it will do a lighter (lower ratio) gain reduction just below the threshold, and then some compressors have pre-comp, or internal/external side-chaining, but at the end when all is said done, all that it produces is a gain reduction curve, that we may or may not compensate for by make up gain!

 So at the end of the day, a compressor is automating a task that we would have to do using volume automation. It would just be really hard to do with the precision of a program/piece of hardware, and take a long time to do.

  That said, there may be instances where our source signal is complex enough that this automated task may itself need to be automated. If I have to adjust/automate a bunch of parameters on a compressor, just to generate a single line of gain reduction, I may as well do it myself! So that's what we're gonna look at in this video!

**Pre-Requisites**  
 In this video I'll utilize pooled automation items to make this task a bit more easy and intuitive! The video will show all that's needed, but the topic of automation items has been covered previously [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf8TFQ8ov_s) so I recommend you watch that as a bit of a primer if you've never seen them!
