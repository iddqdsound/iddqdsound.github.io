## Radial Menu by Lokasenna
![](/blog/misc/8/Radial.png)   

Hey folks!  
 In [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/XP0shh1mTL4) we’re looking at a great way to run actions in REAPER, if you, like this commenter below, can't memorize too many hotkeys. 

  It's a long comment, and I'll in fact be addressing different parts of this in the next few videos:  
  ![](/blog/misc/8/Comment.png)

   But today I thought to start by debunking this bit:  

   _But anyway, my memory for key commands, mouse modifiers and such is not that good. I remember one or two, but nowhere near what is possible. What I really need is more RAM in my brain I guess.... For the rest I have to use the menu. And that sucks. For one because you miss all the options that you can get from SWS and Reapack_

This isn't true. There are, just by default, 4 ways to run any action, whether from Vanilla REAPER, or any SWS Action or any custom script:  
1. Run it from the action list.  
2. Assign a hotkey to it.  
3. Run it from a Toolbar.  
4. Add it to a menu.   

 So even if you can't memorize hotkeys, you are not limited in any way when it comes to running actions. Of course, Running stuff from the action list may be slow, and setting up toolbars and menus are time-consuming, but the time you spend doing that will definitely pay off if your action needs are complex.  

  This is overall something to contend with as a REAPER user: The more easy you want access to certain features to be, the more set up is required. 

Other than the 4 above, there are some extra options, like [Contextual Toolbars](https://youtu.be/xuiB8aGDO18) which we have discussed previously, and we will cover a few other approaches to running actions in future videos, but today I want to show you something totally different: The Radial menu.

 Now the setup for this is very very time-consuming, which is why I took a lot of time to pimp mine and I'm gonna share its code with you. Simply download the file below, open the Radial Menu Settings, go to the options tab, and Import Settings. 

Here it is: [IDDQDSOUND_RADIAL-MENU-2209](/blog/misc/8/IDDQDSound_RadialMenu.txt)

Instructions:  
-Download & Install the Radial Menu through ReaPack. You will need the Lokasenna GUI Library v2 as well as this script. Search for both and install them via ReaPack.  
-Download the text file above and put it anywhere on your computer.  
-Open the Radial Menu Settings by running the action.  
-Go to the options Tab, Import Settings..., and choose the text file above.  
-Done!!  

 I will be ocassionally updating mine as I find new and cool actions that would go well with it. I myself use this in a totally different way, but for that you gotta watch the video:
