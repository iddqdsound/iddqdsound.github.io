## Automation Modes Quiz & Cheat Sheet!

![](/blog/quizzes/1/18.jpg)

Hey folks!

I have recently been covering the topic of automation in my [Rapid-Fire Reaper Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjvmrOUg3J0qUO8LLIbJTYD7j0l9VUsJ3) Series. I have made 8 episodes on this topic alone and planning to do more in the future. In the meantime, I thought I could challenge you with a quick quiz on Automation Writing modes, as well as give you a cheat sheet to use if you are still foggy on this stuff!

Play the quiz below and don't scroll down if you want to avoid spoilers. Otherwise, feel free to just go and download the cheat sheet. You can save it as an image or download the pdf version on the bottom of the page.

So here's the quiz:
