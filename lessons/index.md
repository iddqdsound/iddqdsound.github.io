## QUALIFICATIONS  
Apart from having 10 years of teaching experience, I have a BA Degree in '21st Century Music' from Istanbul Bilgi University. I feel very privileged to have been able to hone my skills through this incredibly unique program. In 2013, I was offered a full scholarship to study at Bilgimuzik. I was very impressed with this progressive program. As the name suggests, '21st Century Music' was a music program that, instead of offering a conventional music program, aimed to train musicians for the modern music landscape. Many of us who were accepted were not conservatory-trained. In fact, some of my classmates didn't play any instruments at all. Instead, Bilgimuzik allowed each student to choose their own adventure!  
There were a few classes we all took, like Music Theory, History & Basic Production, but from there, you were free to tailor the degree to your own needs, with some going deeper into Music Theory & Performance, and others focusing on production, and we even had an extensive music programming course!  
Long story short, in my 4 years at Bilgimuzik I took as many classes as I could, and went down every path, studying extensive music theory & modal harmony, as well as music production, and even dove into Music Cognition, live sound & many other fields within the Audio world! Having taken all those classes places me in a unique position as a teacher, as I am able to offer a wide range of lessons. I am able to truly tailor classes to the needs of every student, and I can comfortably jump from branch to branch with them, exploring different aspects of Music & Audio as inspiration strikes!  
While studying at Bilgimuzik, I also worked in music studios, live music venues, and made lots of records as a session musician, gaining lots of real-life experience!  
After graduating from Bilgi in 2017, I moved to Canada to study Sound Design at Vancouver Film School, an intensive course that solidified my knowlege of recording, DAWs, and prepared me to work in audio post-production for Films, TV, Video games & other visual media. After graduating in 2019, I began working as a freelance dialogue/podcast editor, film composer & post-producton mixer.  
Throughout this entire journey, I never stopped teaching classes. Teaching can be an incredible learning tool in an of itself. I've developed a knack for structuring my classes in a way that closely mimics real-life projects, as I'm a big believer in learning by doing. I encourage experimentation, failure and help my students not only learn their craft, but to become problem-solvers, work in sub-optimal conditions and with sub-optimal gear, all of which are skills that have made me an asset in the professional world, as much as my qualifications have.

## TESTIMONIALS  
Read what some of my former students have said about our classes below:

_"Arya is a fantastic teacher: knowledgeable and patient, and great at explaining complex ideas in a way I can digest. The hands-on, real-time approach is so helpful for me. Even when I ask a vague question about a concept I'm curious about, he knows EXACTLY what to show me to fill the gaps in my knowledge. If you want to learn about REAPER, production & making music in general, I highly recommend setting up a lesson with this guy."_  
**Natalie S., REAPER 101**

_"As a voice actor, I was quite worried about my employment prospects during the pandemic. In only a handful of lessons, Arya helped me set up REAPER to record and mix my own audiobook. Being able to market myself as a one man operation has opened up even more doors for me than before. Thank you!"_
**Steve B., REAPER 201**

_"Arya knows his stuff. His teaching is easy going without lacking in rigour. He is engaging, attentive and funny. He is very dedicated to the task at hand and voil√†!"_  
**Isabelle, Logic Pro X 101**

_"Interested and dedicated"_
**Nicolo P., Music Production**

_"Arya is great to work with. He knows mixing and music composition inside and out and finds creative ways to teach, I highly recommend him."_
**Craig D., Songwriting & Production**

_"Arya is an excellent teacher. He makes it very easy to understand tough concepts. He was able to give me a perfect mix of all the different topics I was interested in!"_
**Mathieu, Music Theory & Production**
