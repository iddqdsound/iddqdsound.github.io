## QUALIFICATIONS  
Apart from having 10 years of teaching experience, I have a BA Degree in '21st Century Music' from Istanbul Bilgi University. I feel very privileged to have been able to hone my skills through this incredibly unique program. In 2013, I was offered a full scholarship to study Music in Turkey, my previous home away from home. Despite never having planned to seek higher education in music, I was very impressed with this progressive program. As the name suggests, '21st Century Music' was a music program like no other. Instead of offering a conventional conservatory-style music program, Bilgimuzik's aim was to train musicians for the modern music landscape. Many of us who were accepted were not conservatory-trained. In fact, some of my classmates didn't play any instruments at all. Instead, Bilgimuzik allowed each student to choose their own adventure!  
There were a few classes we all took, like Music Theory, History & Basic Production, but from there, you were free to tailor the degree to your own needs, with some going deeper into Music Theory & Performance, and others focusing on production, and we even had an extensive music programming course.  
Long story short, in my 4 years at Bilgimuzik I took as many classes as I could, and went down every path, studying extensive music theory, as well as music production, and even dove into Music Cognition, live sound & many other fields within the Audio world! Having taken all those classes placed me in a unique position as a teacher, as I am able to offer a large range of lessons, from Music Theory & Songwriting, to Recording, Production, and everything between. This allows me to truly tailor classes to the needs of every student, and I can comfortably jump branch to branch with them, exploring different aspects of Music & Audio as inspiration strikes!  
While studying at Bilgimuzik, I also worked in music studios, live music venues, and made lots of records as a session musician.  
After graduating from Bilgi in 2017, I moved to Canada to study Sound Design at Vancouver Film School, an intensive course that solidified my knowlege of recording, DAWs, and prepared me to work in audio post-production for Films, TV, Video games & other visual media. After graduating in 2019, I began working as a freelance dialogue/podcast editor, film composer & post-producton mixer.  
Throughout this entire journey, I never stopped teaching classes. Teaching can be an incredible learning tool in an off itself. I've developed a knack for structuring my classes in a way that closely mimics real-life projects, as I believe doing to be the best way of learning! I encourage experimentation, failure and help my students not only learn their craft, but how to become problem-solvers, work in sub-optimal conditions and with sub-optimal gear, all of which are skills that have made me an asset in the professional work, as much as my qualifications have.
