## REAPER DAW 101  
With its 60$ price tag, REAPER is an affordable, yet extremely powerful DAW unlike any other! Packed to the brim with features & offering an unparalleled level of customization, there's endless possibilities for everyone from musicians, to podcasters, to post-production sound crew and even video editors. It's probably easier to list the things REAPER can't do, rather than spend days talking about what it can do! Additionally, REAPER is one of the most resource-conscious DAWs on the market, making it possible to run on any system, OS, from a cheap laptop to a supercomputer.

All of this has the downside of making REAPER somewhat of an intimidating DAW for beginners. The good news is, you don't necessarily have to dig into the depths of REAPER as a beginner. Right out of its 18MB box, REAPER is set up to function. The other good news is, you'll be exploring it with me! Since 2019, I have fully switched to REAPER as my DAW of choice for all my work, from writing, recording & producing music, to all my film sound work, and even video editing for my tutorials & music videos!

I have also amassed a huge back-catalogue of REAPER tutorials, tips & tricks on [my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/IDDQDMusic) which will suit intermediate & advanced users more, but in the meantime, I've been carefully devising a curriculum for REAPER beginners for the past year, and I'm finally proud to present my REAPER 101 Course! This 30-Hour course begins with a blank REAPER project, and by the end, you will be able to navigate REAPER's endless maze of features with ease. Since it's nearly impossible to explore the entirety of this fantastic DAW in a single lifetime, let alone 30 hours, this course is mostly designed to provide you with the basics, and equip you with the skills to find what you need quickly and efficiently.

 ## ADDITIONAL INFO
 -At the average pace, students are able to finish this course in 30 1-hour lessons or 20 90-minute lessons.
 -After each lesson, there will be homework, which takes 1-3 hours to complete. Therefore, I'd recommend one weekly class for students with other obligations such as work or other studies, and two weekly lessons for students able to dedicate more than 10 hours every week to classes & homework.
 -Your homework will consist of working on your project assignments, as well as reading & watching additional articles & tutorial. This frees us to focus our lesson time on more student-specific topics.
 -During our first free lessons, I will be assessing your level, and can modify the curriculum based on that. If you're already familiar with the basics, you can finish this course earlier, or we can begin to cover some extra topics from my Advanced REAPER Class.
 -You're free to take as many or as few classes as you wish, but it's highly recommended that you finish any of the 3 parts that we start on.
 -Lessons can be delivered in English, Turkish or Farsi.
 -This class is not recommended to visually impaired students. While there are certain features & 3rd party apps that can assist the visually in navigating REAPER, I do not feel qualified to guide you through this. Get in touch with me, however, and I can hopefully help nudge you in the right direction!
 -For remote classes, it is important that we have a reliable system to send high-quality audio back and forth to each other! I'd normally recommend one of the below two options:
 1. OBS & Discord: Using these two free apps, we can set up a two-way system to send in-DAW audio, as well as a microphone feed for verbal communication. While free, this set-up is complicated and it may take us an additional hour of set up! I try to get this done during the first free lesson, but complications have been known to arise.
 2. Audiomovers Plugin: Audiomovers is a subscription-based plugin (roughly 8 dollars a month, including a 2-week free trial) that makes this process very easy. If you are okay with the cost, This method is quick to set up, and allows us to use Zoom or Skype to do the lessons.
