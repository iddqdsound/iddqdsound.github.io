## RAPID-FIRE REAPER TUTORIALS
 Short, Fast-paced tutorials exploring some of REAPER's vast toolkit & customization options. Since most tutorials are inspired by viewer questions, there's no real order to watching most of this series, but you can see these sorted under various topics.


## SOUND EDITING & DESIGN FOR VISUAL MEDIA
 In this series, I explore workflow tips & share knowledge I've picked up doing Sound Editing, Foley Recording, Sound Design, Dialogue Editing & Post-Production Mixing for Film, TV, and other visual media, in REAPER. 
 My own career in Sound Design began in Pro Tools, but I have since been able to fully transition to REAPER, and I want to share some of REAPER's wonderful capabilities in this realm of audio!


## MIXING FEEDBACK MONDAYS
 In This series I take projects from my viewers and provide detailed feedback to them. If you want to send me a mix, you can do so by becoming a member of the YouTube Channel, and you can receive feedback for one project every month, but feel free to contact me at mfm@iddqdsound.com if you are interested in a one-off feedback session! 

## LET'S LEARN SCRIPTING IN REAPER
 I am far from a professional coder myself, but with a little bit of help from REAPER community of coders, I've been exploring some of the scripting capabilities of REAPER through Tutorials and Livestreams, featuring mentors such as Leandro Facchinetti, Geraint Luff & Bo Danerius.

## SOUND RECIPES
 This series focuses on some of the whacky FX that I've concocted.
